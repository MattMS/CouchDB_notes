# Sending HTTP requests

Working with CouchDB is done with HTTP requests.


## Browser

For reading data (`GET` requests) you can enter these in the location
bar of your web browser.
The browser window will then display the result of the request.


## Postman

If you use Google Chrome, you can add the
[Postman extension](https://www.getpostman.com/)
from the
[Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en-US).

This will let you send other types of requests, along with `GET`.

Similar to [Futon](../Futon/), this is most useful for testing.


## Python requests

If you are writing scripts in [Python](https://www.python.org/) then you
should check out
[Python requests](http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/).

	pip install requests
