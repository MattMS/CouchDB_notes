# Learn CouchDB

Learn how to use CouchDB.


## Disclaimer

These notes have been created while I am learning CouchDB.
They will probably change as I learn more.
This is *not* a tutorial by a CouchDB expert.

You have been warned!


## Why read this?

I had trouble understanding many of the workflows in CouchDB.
Most documentation I found seemed to make assumptions of prior knowledge
that prevented me from using what I was learning.

This is my attempt at fixing the pain points I had.
